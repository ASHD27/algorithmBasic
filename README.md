## Training Algorithm

### This repository is meant for solving algorithm problems and practicing algorithm theory.

Anyone can contribute this repository if you follow below guidlines.

1. File name
   : You should create a name for the file as below.
   "site name" + "problem number" + "\_" + "your nickname".cpp

- Examples
  CF1426C_khusw.cpp, LC852_khusw.cpp

"site name" means a coding problem solving site such as codeforce, leetcode, baekjoon online judge ...

when determining "site name", it should be abbreviated.
(codeforce -> CF, leetcode -> LC, baekjoon online judge -> BOJ ...)

If you have simply created the basic code for the algorithm, rather than solving the algorithm problem, you should name the file Basic_nickname.cpp

- Examples
  Basic_khusw.cpp, Basic_abc.cpp

2. Folder name
   : Folder name should be specified as "the language name used" / "the algorithm name used"

- Examples
  cpp/DP, cpp/DFS, cpp/Dijkstra

3. Review
   : Everyone can review each other's codes. If you find someone's code is logically wrong, create issue.
